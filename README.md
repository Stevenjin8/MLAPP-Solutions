Solutions and thoughts on Kevin Murphy's *Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*, first printing.

I have a moderate math background (multivariable calculus and intro stats) and I often find parts of *Machine Learning: a Probilistic Perspective* unclear. The goal of this project is to help others in a similar position work through this book. I provide detailed answers to selected exercises and (hopefully) helpful comments on sections that I find unclear.

This project is also a chance for me to learn LaTeX and familiarize myself with writing math. If you have any feedback (however specific or general) please raise an issue or send me a message. If this project has helped you in any way, I would appreciate a star.
